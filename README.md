## Inspiration
We were mostly inspired by the struggles we experienced throughout highschool. We tried to reflect on the support we wished we had, and the things we wished we could have done.
## What it does
A!dMate helps connect students to various support systems that they may not be aware of. It gives students access to other students in their area, teachers outside of their home school, Alumni and people in their desired fields. It also gives students a place to collaborate, compiling various homework and test assignments for students to help each other with.
## How we built it
The GUI for the project was coded using cometchat. We used ChatGPT and the OpenAI's built-in API to suggest relevant chats for the student to visit.
## Challenges we ran into
Initally, we had planned to have the API sift through the various chats in order to find place the user in the right direction. However, we had more trouble than expected when working with Json, so we ended up simplifying it, having ChatGPT instead point the user to the correct chat based on one word indicators.
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
I think as a team, we're fairly happy that we came out of this with a semi-functional product. Also, although not implemented on the GUI, we had a fairly nice looking design for the Apps homepage.
## What we learned
I think we learned to keep things simple. Making a complicated AI API, machine intelligence monster of an app may sound enticing but understanding our time constraints, we needed to be realistic about what we could accomplish. 
## What's next for A!dMate
I think it would be good to smooth out the UI, making it look better and perform more smoothly for the users. We'd also like to further develop the API, and look into the chat databases.
